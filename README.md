# ReactJS Chess

This is a web chess game coded in React. Feel free to contribute as this is an open source project!

## How to Play

Click the piece you want to move, and then click the desired destination. Users play against a simple chess engine.

## Features

You play as the white player, and black is controlled by a simple chess AI (implemented using the minimax algorithm). Most of the rules of chess, from castling to not being able to put yourself in check, are fully implemented. Draws and time limits are not enabled. I also implemented time travel, so that users can view previous moves.

## Demo

You can play here: [ReactJS Chess](https://arpansahoo.github.io/ReactJS-Chess/).
